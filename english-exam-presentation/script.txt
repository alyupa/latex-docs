Why Good Thoughts Block Better Ones

Hello, everyone. My name is Anastasia Lyupa. I'm a first year
post-graduate student of MIPT, department of Control and Applied Mathematics.
I’d like to thank you for attending this presentation.
What I’d like to present to you today is Why Good Thoughts Block Better Ones.
Have you ever noticed that when you know a solution of a typical problem and
solve the similar but easier one, you use that known complex way instead of a much more 
simplier new solution?
That's why this topic is attractive for me and I believe that it will
be entertaining for all of you too.
My talk will take about ten minutes and if you have any questions,
I’ll be happy to answer them at the end.

I’ve divided my presentation into four parts.
I’ll start with experiments that introduce the effect clearly. 
Secondly, I'll describe its impact on reasoning. 
After that I'll talk about ways to counteract it.
To finish up I’ll make a conclusion.

That brings me to the end of my presentation.
To sum up, I've spoken about the Einstellung effect. It's about how our
experience changes our points of view.
Firstly, I've told you about curious experiments that show it.
Secondly, I've shown how harmful this effect is.
Lastly, I've introduced some ways to avoid its influence.
In conclusion I would like to say that it's rather dangerous for researchers
to support only known or pleasing ideas and reject unfavourable ones.
I hope after this talk you will pay more attention on this problem
and will be more objective in your thoughts.  
Thank you for your kind attention.
And now, if anyone has any questions, I’d be happy to answer them.
